# Project: Testing Practice

This project covers a set of JavaScript utility functions and demonstrates the use of unit testing using Jest. The goal is to build reliable, thoroughly tested functions while practicing the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The project includes the following features:

1. capitalize(string): A function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

2. reverseString(string): A function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

3. calculator object: An object that contains the following basic mathematical operations:

- add(a, b): Adds two numbers and returns the result.
- subtract(a, b): Subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.
- divide(a, b): Divides the first number by the second and returns the result.
- multiply(a, b): Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.

4. A function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns the string with each character shifted according to the Caesar Cipher technique.
